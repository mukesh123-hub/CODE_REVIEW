Okay, I've reviewed the code snippet:

```javascript
function sum() {return a + b;}
```

Here's my assessment and suggestions:

**Issues:**

*   **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum` is intended to calculate the sum of two numbers, but it doesn't accept any parameters. It relies on variables `a` and `b` being defined in an outer scope (global or closure). This is generally bad practice because:
    *   **Unpredictability:**  The function's behavior depends on where it's called and what values `a` and `b` happen to have in that scope at the time of the call.
    *   **Maintainability:** It makes the code harder to understand and debug because you have to trace where `a` and `b` are defined and modified.
    *   **Reusability:** The function is not reusable in different contexts without ensuring `a` and `b` are correctly set.

*   **Implicit Globals (Potential):** If `a` and `b` are not declared with `let`, `const`, or `var` *before* the function is called, JavaScript will implicitly create them as global variables.  This is almost always undesirable.

**Recommended Solution:**

Pass the numbers to be summed as parameters to the function. This makes the function self-contained, predictable, and reusable.

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Parameters:** The function now accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. These will hold the values passed when the function is called.
*   **Local Scope:**  `a` and `b` are now local variables within the `sum` function.  Their values are determined solely by the arguments passed to the function. 

**Example Usage:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // result will be 8
console.log(result);

let x = 10;
let y = 20;
let anotherResult = sum(x, y); // anotherResult will be 30
console.log(anotherResult);
```

**Further Improvements and Considerations (Depending on Context):**

*   **Error Handling (If Necessary):**  If you need to handle cases where the input might not be numbers, you could add a check:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a, b) {
      if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers."; // Or throw an error    
      }
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

*   **Default Parameters (If Appropriate):** If you want to provide default values for `a` or `b` if they're not provided during the function call:

    ```javascript
    function sum(a = 0, b = 0) {
      return a + b;
    }

    console.log(sum());      // Output: 0
    console.log(sum(5));     // Output: 5
    console.log(sum(5, 2));  // Output: 7
    ```

*   **Arrow Function (Shorter Syntax):**  For a simple function like this, you could use a more concise arrow function:

    ```javascript
    const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
    ```

**In summary, the most important change is to pass the values `a` and `b` as parameters to the function to make it more robust, understandable, and reusable.**  The other suggestions are for adding error handling or using a more concise syntax, depending on your specific needs.
