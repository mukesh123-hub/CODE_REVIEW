Okay, I've reviewed your JavaScript code snippet:

```javascript
function sum(){return a+b;}
```

Here's my feedback, focusing on potential issues and improvements:

**Issues and Suggestions**

1. **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not declared within the function's scope or in any enclosing
scope. This will lead to unexpected behavior or errors, depending on the JavaScript environment (e.g., in strict mode,
it will throw a `ReferenceError`).

* **Suggestion:** You need to define where `a` and `b` come from. The most common approach for a `sum` function is to
pass them as arguments:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

Or, if `a` and `b` are intended to be global variables (which is generally discouraged), make sure they are declared and
initialized *before* the `sum` function is called.

2. **Missing Functionality:** The code only defines the function but doesn't actually *call* the function to calculate
and potentially display the sum.

* **Suggestion:** You need to call the function and do something with the result:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

let result = sum(5, 3); // Example: call with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result); // Display the result (8)
```

**Revised Code (with arguments):**

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}

// Example usage:
const num1 = 10;
const num2 = 5;
const total = sum(num1, num2);

console.log(`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is: ${total}`); // Output the result
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

* **Arguments:** The `sum` function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`. This makes the function reusable and
predictable.
* **Example Usage:** I've added example code to demonstrate how to call the function with specific values and how to
display the result using `console.log`. I've also used template literals (backticks) for more readable string
formatting.
* **`const`:** I used `const` to declare `num1`, `num2`, and `total` because their values are not expected to change
after initialization. Use `let` if a variable's value might change later.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Always declare variables:** This prevents errors and makes your code more readable.
* **Functions should generally accept arguments:** This makes them reusable and flexible.
* **Call your functions:** Defining a function is only half the battle; you need to execute it to get a result.
* **Consider scope:** Understand where your variables are defined and accessible.
* **Use `const` and `let` appropriately:** Favor `const` when the value won't change.
